# Silk Stocking Shader for ME
A shader mod for HS2 / AIS MaterialEditor. It's based on [Blake/Silk Stocking Shader](https://github.com/Blatke/Silk-Stocking-Shader), which is a shaderlab coded shader in Unity.

## What is it?
It's for making an object more lika a silk stocking. As shown in the screenshot, the shader is loaded to the material of the pants that a character is wearing. By default, the closer it is near by the bumps on the legs, the more transparency it will show so that the character's skins could be seen (it's what they called Fresnel effect).
